/*! \page installdox_usage Installdox usage

Installdox is a perl script that is generated by doxygen whenever
tag files are used (See \c TAGFILES
in section \ref config_extref). The script is 
located in the same directory where the HTML files are located. 

Its purpose is to set the location of the external documentation 
for each tag file at install time.

Calling \c installdox with option <b>-h</b> at the command line 
will give you a brief description of the usage of the program.

The following options are available:
<dl>
<dt><b>-l <tt>\<tagfile\>\@\<location\></tt></b><dd> 
   Each tag file contains information about the files, classes and members
   documented in a set of HTML files. A user can install these
   HTML files anywhere on his/her hard disk or web site. 
   Therefore installdox \e requires the location of the
   documentation for each tag file <tt>\<tagfile\></tt> 
   that is used by doxygen. The location <tt>\<location\></tt> can be 
   an absolute path or a URL.

   \par Note:
     Each \<tagfile\> must be unique and should only be the name of the
     file, not including the path. 

<dt><b>-q</b><dd>
   When this option is specified, installdox will generate no output other
   than fatal errors.
</dl>
Optionally a list of HTML files may be given. 
These files are scanned and modified if needed.
If this list is omitted all files in the current directory 
that end with \c .html are used.

The \c installdox script is unique for each generated class browser
in the sense that it `knows' what tag files are used. It will generate an error if 
the <b>-l</b> option is missing for a tag file or if an invalid tag file 
is given.
