/*! \page formulas Including formulas 

Doxygen allows you to put \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ formulas in the
output (this works only for the HTML and \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ output, 
not for the RTF nor for the man page output). To be able to include 
formulas (as images) in the HTML documentation, you will also need to 
have the following tools installed
<ul>
<li>\c latex: the \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ compiler, needed to parse the formulas. 
    To test I have used the teTeX 1.0 distribution.
<li>\c dvips: a tool to convert DVI files to PostScript files 
    I have used version 5.92b from Radical Eye software for testing.
<li>\c gs: the GhostScript interpreter for converting PostScript files 
    to bitmaps. I have used Aladdin GhostScript 8.0 for testing.
</ul>
For the HTML output there is also an alternative solution using
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> which does not
require the above tools. If you enable \ref cfg_use_mathjax "USE_MATHJAX" in
the config then the latex formulas will be copied to the HTML "as is" and a
client side javascript will parse them and turn them into (interactive) images.

There are three ways to include formulas in the documentation.
<ol>
<li>Using in-text formulas that appear in the running text. 
    These formulas should be put between a pair of \\f\$ 
    commands, so
\verbatim
  The distance between \f$(x_1,y_1)\f$ and \f$(x_2,y_2)\f$ is 
  \f$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\f$.
\endverbatim results in:

  The distance between \f$(x_1,y_1)\f$ and \f$(x_2,y_2)\f$ is 
  \f$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\f$.
<br>
<li>Unnumbered displayed formulas that are centered on a separate line.
    These formulas should be put between \\f[ and \\f] commands.
    An example:
\verbatim
  \f[
    |I_2|=\left| \int_{0}^T \psi(t) 
             \left\{ 
                u(a,t)-
                \int_{\gamma(t)}^a 
                \frac{d\theta}{k(\theta,t)}
                \int_{a}^\theta c(\xi)u_t(\xi,t)\,d\xi
             \right\} dt
          \right|
  \f]
\endverbatim
  results in:
  \f[
    |I_2|=\left| \int_{0}^T \psi(t) 
             \left\{ 
                u(a,t)-
                \int_{\gamma(t)}^a 
                \frac{d\theta}{k(\theta,t)}
                \int_{a}^\theta c(\xi)u_t(\xi,t)\,d\xi
             \right\} dt
          \right|
  \f]
<li>Formulas or other latex elements that are not in a math 
    environment can be specified using \\f{environment}, where
    \c environment is the name of the \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ environment, 
    the corresponding end command is \\f}. Here is an example for an 
    equation array
\verbatim
   \f{eqnarray*}{
        g &=& \frac{Gm_2}{r^2} \\ 
          &=& \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,\mbox{m}^3\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,
              \mbox{s}^{-2})(5.9736 \times 10^{24}\,\mbox{kg})}{(6371.01\,\mbox{km})^2} \\ 
          &=& 9.82066032\,\mbox{m/s}^2
   \f}
\endverbatim
  which results in:
   \f{eqnarray*}
        g &=& \frac{Gm_2}{r^2} \\ 
          &=& \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,\mbox{m}^3\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,
              \mbox{s}^{-2})(5.9736 \times 10^{24}\,\mbox{kg})}{(6371.01\,\mbox{km})^2} \\ 
          &=& 9.82066032\,\mbox{m/s}^2
   \f}
</ol>
For the first two commands one should make sure formulas contain 
valid commands in \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$'s math-mode. For the third command
the section should contain valid command for the specific environment.

\warning Currently, doxygen is not very fault tolerant in recovering 
from typos in formulas. It may be necessary to remove the
file <code>formula.repository</code> that is written to the html directory to 
get rid of an incorrect formula.
