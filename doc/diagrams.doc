/*! \page diagrams Graphs and diagrams

  Doxygen has built-in support to generate inheritance diagrams for C++
  classes. 

  Doxygen can use the "dot" tool from graphviz to generate
  more advanced diagrams and graphs. Graphviz is an open-source, 
  cross-platform graph drawing toolkit and can be found 
  at http://www.graphviz.org/

  If you have the "dot" tool in the path, you can set
  \ref cfg_have_dot "HAVE_DOT" to \c YES in the configuration file to 
  let doxygen use it.

  Doxygen uses the "dot" tool to generate the following graphs:
  <ul>
  <li>A graphical representation of the class hierarchy will be drawn, along 
      with the textual one. Currently this feature is supported for HTML only.\n
      <b>Warning:</b> When you have a very large class hierarchy where many 
      classes derive from a common base class, the resulting image may become 
      too big to handle for some browsers.
  <li>An inheritance graph will be generated for each documented class showing the 
      direct and indirect inheritance relations. This disables the
      generation of the built-in class inheritance diagrams.
  <li>An include dependency graph is generated for each documented file that 
      includes at least one other file. This feature is currently supported 
      for HTML and RTF only.
  <li>An inverse include dependency graph is also generated showing for
      a (header) file, which other files include it.
  <li>A graph is drawn for each documented class and struct that shows:
      <ul>
      <li> the inheritance relations with base classes.
      <li> the usage relations with other structs and classes (e.g. 
           class \c A has a member variable \c m_a of type class \c B, then
           \c A has an arrow to \c B with \c m_a as label).
      </ul>
  <li>if \ref cfg_call_graph "CALL_GRAPH" is set to YES, a 
      graphical call graph is drawn for each function showing the 
      functions that the function directly or indirectly calls.
  <li>if \ref cfg_caller_graph "CALLER_GRAPH" is set to YES, a 
      graphical caller graph is drawn for each function showing the 
      functions that the function is directly or indirectly called by.
  </ul>

  Using a \ref customize "layout file" you can determine which of the
  graphs are actually shown.

  The options \ref cfg_dot_graph_max_nodes "DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES" and
  \ref cfg_max_dot_graph_depth "MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH" can be used to 
  limit the size of the various graphs.

  The elements in the class diagrams in HTML and RTF 
  have the following meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b yellow box indicates a class. A box can have a 
       little marker in the lower right corner to indicate that the class 
       contains base classes that are hidden. 
       For the class diagrams the maximum tree width is currently 8 elements. 
       If a tree is wider some nodes will be hidden.
       If the box is filled with a 
       dashed pattern the inheritance relation is virtual.
  <li> A \b white box indicates that the documentation of the class
       is currently shown.
  <li> A \b gray box indicates an undocumented class.
  <li> A <b>solid dark blue</b> arrow indicates public inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dashed dark green</b> arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dotted dark green</b> arrow indicates private inheritance.
  </ul>

  The elements in the class diagram in \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ have the 
  following meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b white box indicates a class.
       A \b marker in the lower right corner of the box indicates that the 
       class has base classes that are hidden. 
       If the box has a \b dashed border this indicates virtual inheritance.
  <li> A \b solid arrow indicates public inheritance.
  <li> A \b dashed arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A \b dotted arrow indicates private inheritance.
  </ul>

  The elements in the graphs generated by the dot tool have the following
  meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b white box indicates a class or struct or file. 
  <li> A box with a \b red border indicates a node that has
       \e more arrows than are shown! 
       In other words: the graph is \e truncated with respect to this node.
       The reason why a graph is sometimes truncated is to prevent images
       from becoming too large. 
       For the graphs generated with dot doxygen tries
       to limit the width of the resulting image to 1024 pixels.  
  <li> A \b black box indicates that the class' documentation is currently shown.
  <li> A <b>dark blue</b> arrow indicates an include relation (for the 
       include dependency graph) or public inheritance (for the other graphs).
  <li> A <b>dark green</b> arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dark red</b> arrow indicates private inheritance.
  <li> A <b>purple dashed</b> arrow indicated a "usage" relation, the 
       edge of the arrow is labeled with the variable(s) responsible for the
       relation.
       Class \c A uses class \c B, if class \c A has a member variable \c m 
       of type C, where B is a subtype of C (e.g. C could be \c B, \c B*, <code>T\<B\>*</code> ). 
  </ul>


Here are a couple of header files that together show the various diagrams
that doxygen can generate: 

<code>diagrams_a.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_a.h
<code>diagrams_b.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_b.h
<code>diagrams_c.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_c.h
<code>diagrams_d.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_d.h
<code>diagrams_e.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_e.h
