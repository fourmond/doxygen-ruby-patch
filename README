Doxygen with Ruby support

This is a fork of doxygen that provides Ruby support. The extra code
was written by Vincent Fourmond <vincent.fourmond@9online.fr>. Apart
from that, it behaves exactly like a normal doxygen (with respect to
the installation instructions, for instance).

This fork exists solely for testing purposes; when the code is mature
enough, my hope is that it will integrate mainstream Doxygen.
